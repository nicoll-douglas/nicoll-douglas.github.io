          Lorem is a messaging board where you can interact with people through
          various different boards, threads and replies. It functions like many
          forums you come across on the internet but with a more modern and
          user-friendly UI. It is the first truly full-stack project (meaning
          both a front-end/UI and a backend/server/API) I have built as a web
          developer and it has taught me a lot.

          I count my portfolio as one of my projects because like many of my
          projects, it was one where I was able to explore and try new
          technologies as well as exercise skills I have already gained. The
          process included making my own custom design using
          <a class="text-red-400" href="https://www.figma.com">Figma</a>, and
          then building it using NextJS and Chakra UI which were my technologies
          of choice.

          This is a small side-project I did that tackles an interesting Data
          Structures & Algorithms coding challenge. The challenge being, given
          start and end positions on a chessboard, one must find the shortest
          possible number of moves a knight could take to traverse between them.
          A very interesting problem with a very eloquent solution that I had a
          lot of fun with and I really should do more stuff like this I think.
