            Mr Robot: A Reflection of our Modern Dystopia
          </h1>
          <hr class="my-2" />
          <p>
            Mr. Robot is perhaps one of the most real and chronically relevant
            pieces of cinema to emerge in the 21st century. The show may have
            aired its final episode in 2019, but the themes it explores are just
            as relevant today and will likely remain so for decades to come. Set
            against a backdrop of global financial meltdown and the rising power
            of corporations, Mr. Robot taps into the frustrations and anxieties
            that have come to define our current economic and social climate. In
            an era marked by a sense of powerlessness and growing inequality,
            the show brilliantly captures that zeitgeist and articulates the
            discontent that many of us feel.

                Control and the Top 1% of the Top 1%
              </h2>
              <hr />
            </div>
            <p>
              At its core, Mr. Robot is a story about control—who has it, who
              doesn&apos;t, and the nature of those who realise the truth. The
              story revolves around Elliot Alderson, a clinically depressed,
              disillusioned cybersecurity engineer by day and vigilante hacker
              by night. Recruited by the insurrectionary anarchist known as
              &quot;Mr. Robot&quot;, Elliot joins &quot;Fsociety&quot;, a hacker
              group who plan on erasing all debt records and taking down E Corp,
              an all-powerful conglomerate that controls everything from banking
              to technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sound familiar? It should, because the world that Mr. Robot enacts
              as it&apos;s setting isn&apos;t a dystopian fantasy—it&apos;s a
              thinly veiled reflection of our own. We live in a time where
              corporations, tech giants, and big banks hold an overbearing
              amount of influence over our lives. Companies like Amazon, Google,
              and Facebook not only dominate entire industries but also wield
              immense power over how we live, work, and think. Company
              executives pull the strings, taking home egregiously large
              bonuses, whilst the struggling worker stays enslaved to their
              ever-stagnant wages. Financial institutions and big banks
              manipulate money to serve their own malignant interests, whilst
              those already struggling bear the brunt of the secondary economic
              impact—it&apos;s a crooked system.
            </p>
            <p>
              The frustration that Elliot feels—the sense that the system is
              rigged and that the average person is powerless to change it—is
              one that has been ever-so prevalent in the last 10 years and
              manifests as Elliot&apos;s hesitant but willing participation in
              Fsociety. In many ways, Mr. Robot serves as a mirror to our own
              reality, where the top 1% of the top 1% continue to consolidate
              wealth and power while the rest of society struggles to make ends
              meet.

                Social Media and the Erosion of Privacy
              </h2>
              <hr />
            </div>
            <p>
              One of the show&apos;s most prevalent themes is its exploration of
              how technology, particularly social media, is used to manipulate
              and control people. In Mr. Robot, Elliot often speaks directly to
              the audience, breaking the fourth wall in his realisation and
              reminder to us that we are being watched, tracked, and fed
              information designed to shape our behaviour—a fact of 21st century
              life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok create
              echo chambers, feeding us biased information based on our likes,
              searches and interactions. This doesn&apos;t just influence what
              we buy or what we eat—it shapes our opinions, our politics, and
              even our sense of reality under the guise of
              &quot;personalisation&quot;. The algorithms designed to keep us
              engaged are also designed to keep us in line, showing us only what
              we want to see or should be shown. We live in an era of mass
              hypnosis, where the lines between truth and fiction blur, the
              manipulators control the masses, and only the unbrainwashed are
              left to witness the horror.
            </p>
            <p>
              As well as controlling the flow of information, these platforms
              are also giant data collection machines. Every search, scroll, and
              like is recorded, analysed, and sold to the highest bidder. Edward
              Snowden&apos;s revelations about mass government surveillance only
              confirmed what many of us suspected: our privacy is a thing of the
              past. We live in an age where both corporations and governments
              have access to our most intimate data, and they are using it to
              influence and control us in ways we are wholly blind to.
            </p>
            <p>
              These ideas of the manipulated reality we live in are gracefully
              expressed in the frictions that occur between Elliot and Mr Robot.
              Elliot, struggling to hold onto a sense of reality and logical
              course of action, comes into conflict with the overbearing
              presence of Mr Robot and what the existence of someone with his
              philosophy means for the side of Elliot that rejects the system.
              Mr Robot presents the fact that the digital and societal illusion
              we live in is met with only one answer: the realness of Mr
              Robot&apos;s existence, his philosophy and his complete rejection
              for the system that perpetuates it.

                The Inner Battle: Elliot&apos;s Struggle with Societal
                Fragmentation
              </h2>
              <hr />
            </div>
            <p>
              Elliot&apos;s struggles with mental illness are central to the
              narrative of Mr. Robot, reflecting not only his personal battle
              but also a broader commentary on how society deals with
              psychological issues. Throughout the show, Elliot grapples with
              his anxiety, depression, and dissociative identity disorder (DID).
              His internal conflict manifests as a constant dialogue between
              himself and his alternate perceptions of reality. This
              psychological fragmentation mirrors how many people feel divided
              between their true selves and the roles society forces them to
              play.
            </p>
            <p>
              In a world dominated by corporations, social media, and external
              pressures. Elliot&apos;s mental struggles highlight how modern
              society often exacerbates feelings of isolation, powerlessness,
              and alienation. Elliot often retreats into his mind, using hacking
              as a way to feel a sense of control that is otherwise absent from
              his life. Hacking is his coping mechanism, a way for him to
              reclaim power and connect with the realest parts of people in a
              world where he feels alienated and helpless otherwise. This
              resonates with how a lot of people today use technology as an
              escape, even as it continues to deepen their isolation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ultimately, Elliot&apos;s journey through mental illness in Mr.
              Robot represents a larger societal issue: the failure to
              adequately address mental health and the impact of systemic forces
              on the individual psyche. His isolation, paranoia, and fractured
              identity serve as metaphors for the modern condition, where the
              pressures of capitalism and social expectations drive people to
              the brink, leaving them to fend for themselves in a system that
              prioritises profits over well-being. His story is a powerful
              reminder that mental health is deeply intertwined with the
              structures of power, control, and alienation in today&apos;s
              world.

                &quot;Control can sometimes be an illusion, but sometimes you
                need illusions to gain control. Fantasy is an easy way to give
                meaning to the world. To cloak our harsh reality with escapist
                comfort. After all, isn&apos;t that why we surround ourselves
                with so many screens? So we can avoid seeing? So we can avoid

                Conclusion: A Mirror to Our Own World
              </h2>
              <hr />
            </div>
            <p>
              If Mr. Robot taught us anything, it&apos;s that the systems
              governing our lives are more twisted and corrupt than we might
              think, and that a lot of people are frustrated by how little power
              they actually have. It holds up a mirror to our own world,
              reflecting the fears, frustrations, and anxieties that have come
              to define life in the 21st century. Whether it&apos;s the growing
              power of corporations, the erosion of privacy, or the alienation
              we feel living in the digital age, the show taps into the unease
              we face and the boiling point we <em>could</em> face in our warped
              and twisted society.
            </p>
            <p>
              The insurrectionary acts that Fsociety and Elliot undertake in the
              show seemingly express this, not as a solution, but as a revolt—a
              full force rejection of the system. The economic meltdown that
              ensues from encrypting E Corp&apos;s financial data and thus
              erasing all debt records, shows the screaming indifference in
              Fsociety&apos;s mentality and their resistance to an utterly
              malignant system. A mentality of &quot;economy or no economy, debt
              or no debt, we will no longer keel over and take it&quot;—that
              indifference is one that many people will continue to relate to
              and what makes Mr Robot a timeless and brilliant, 21st century,
              cinematic expression.
